# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer outcomes using various supervised learning algorithms. The breast cancer dataset from the scikit-learn library is utilized to train and evaluate different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on clinical and laboratory data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in the scikit-learn library. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D-K02/Supervised-Learning-Models--Breast-Cancer-Dataset.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Supervised-Learning-Models--Breast-Cancer-Dataset
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
2. Run the `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` notebook to execute the code.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithm in predicting breast cancer outcomes.
